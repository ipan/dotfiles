Pip currently ignores uninstall commands that try to uninstall something owned by the OS. 
It doesn't error out, like it does with a missing package. So, now you can uninstall with the following process:

    pip freeze > dump.txt

Edit the dumped file to remove any -e "editable install" lines, everything after the == sign
(%s;==.*;;g in vim), swap the new lines for spaces (%s;\n; ;g in vim) or pipe with `tr`

    cat dump.txt  | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo pip uninstall -y

I had to do this procedure twice, because a few packages were installed in ~/.local/lib too.
